## Description
Do you have a lot of work that comes in at random times and needs to be completed
by different deadlines? Have you tried Google tasks? Yea, I have to, it doesn't really
scale for people with a ton of shit to do.

Productive Tasks organizes your tasks by deadlines and categories. Categories are organized like
a computer directory structure:
```
-- root
 | -- personal
    | -- groceries
    | -- chores
    | -- personal projects
       | -- productive tasks app
       | -- startup
    | -- vacation ideas
 | -- work
    | -- current projects
       | -- project 1
       | -- project 2
    | -- old projects
       | -- project 3
       | -- project 4
          | -- feature 1
          | -- feature 2
       | -- project 5
```

Each category/directory can have more directories and/or some tasks listed inside it.

Tasks generally have deadlines associated with them. For the tasks that don't have deadlines,
productive tasks offers a way to sort tasks such that the highest priority ones appear in
your "Top Tasks" list.
